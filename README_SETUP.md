## Quick Setup (Windows PowerShell)

This repo contains a single notebook for the module tasks at `notebooks/problems.ipynb`. Follow these steps to run it locally.

```powershell
# 1) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# If activation fails due to policy restrictions, run once (in PowerShell):
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# 2) Upgrade pip and install requirements
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) (Optional) Add this environment to Jupyter kernels
python -m ipykernel install --user --name faang-lab --display-name "FAANG Lab (.venv)"

# 4) Launch Jupyter and open the notebook
jupyter notebook
# Then open: notebooks/problems.ipynb
```

Troubleshooting
- If a package is missing: `python -m pip install <package>`
- If `yfinance` fails, check internet connectivity and try again later (Yahoo throttling happens occasionally).

Notes
- Use only `requirements.txt` (there is no minimal alt file).
- Data files generated by the notebook live under `notebooks/data/` and are ignored by git.
